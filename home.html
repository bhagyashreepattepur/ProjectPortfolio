        A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, 
        is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants 
        <b>(plants of the division Angiospermae).</b> 
        Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants 
        consist of a few <mark> haploid cells </mark> which produce gametes. 
        The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm,
        is enclosed within pollen grains; the <s>"female"</s> 
        gametophyte is contained within the ovule.
        When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma,
        this is called <i>pollination. </i>
